# Quatuor Danel - Mieczysław Weinberg Quartets
A data visualisation of the string quartets by Mieczysław Weinberg as recorded by Quatuor Danel. All timings (and movement divisions) are from their CPO recordings, except for the Improvisation and Romance, which is as clocked by me during their encore after a performance in Manchester on the 24th March 2024.

Data largely scraped from YouTube (are timings of CDs public domain?) whilst code is from ECharts generated with the help of Claude Opus.
